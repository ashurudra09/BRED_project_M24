# BRED\_project\_M24 Repository

This repository contains information related to the study of how different methods of locomotion impact spatial learning tasks in VR HMD environments. It includes links to the virtual reality environments used, the data collected, and the methods employed for data collection and analysis. The study compares physical walking (Full Gait Technique) with joystick-based navigation (Gait Negation Technique) in a spatial learning task.

## Study Overview

### Abstract

The study investigates the effect of locomotion method (physical walking vs. joystick) on performance in a spatial learning task within a VR head-mounted display (HMD) environment. Participants were tasked with remembering the spatial locations of objects within a virtual room and then recalling and correctly placing the objects back in their original locations. The findings indicate that walking-based navigation significantly enhanced the participant’s performance in spatial learning tasks compared to joystick-based navigation.

### Methods

*   **Participants:** The study included 40 undergraduate college students with a mean age of 19.43 years (SD = 0.931 yrs). Participants were divided into two groups: a Walking condition and a Joystick condition.
*   **Procedure:** The experiment consisted of three phases:
    *   **Familiarization Phase:** Participants were given a detailed explanation of the task and allowed to get comfortable with moving around the virtual environment, avoiding obstacles, and picking up and placing objects.
    *   **Memorization Phase:** Participants were tasked with remembering the locations of objects in a room within a 60-second time limit.
    *   **Recall Phase:** Participants were transported to a new room and asked to place the objects on the correct tables. The time taken to complete this phase and the number of correctly placed objects were recorded.
*   **Equipment:** The scenes were presented using a Meta Quest 3 head-mounted display. Locomotion was facilitated by physical walking in the Walking condition and using the Meta Quest 3’s hand-held joysticks in the Joystick condition.

### Key Findings

*   **Task Performance:** Participants in the Walking condition showed significantly lower task completion times and placed significantly more objects correctly compared to the Joystick condition.
*   **Sense of Presence:** Participants in the Walking condition reported a significantly higher sense of presence compared to the Joystick condition.
*   **Simulator Sickness:** The Joystick condition resulted in significantly higher simulator sickness scores compared to the Walking condition.
*   **No significant correlation** was found between scores of presence or simulator sickness and the two performance metrics, across both conditions.

### Key Concepts

*   **Spatial Cognition:** The collection, organization, use, and revision of information about one’s environment. Spatial information is processed using egocentric and allocentric perspectives.
*   **Locomotion Techniques:**
    *   **Full Gait Techniques (FGTs):** Real walking to move in the virtual environment.
    *   **Gait Negation Techniques (GNTs):** Navigation using joysticks.
*   **Sense of Presence:** The extent to which a virtual environment becomes a user’s subjective reality.
*   **Virtual Reality-Induced Symptoms and Effects (VRISE):** Symptoms that can arise from enhanced visual immersion in VR, potentially hindering cognitive performance.

### Potential Future Directions

*   Longitudinal studies to see whether the effect of locomotion diminishes as the user becomes more comfortable with the controls.
*   Include Partial Gait Techniques such as hand-tracked navigation and walking in place.
*   Validating these findings in real-world applications.
